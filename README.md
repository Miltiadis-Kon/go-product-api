# go-product-api

## Notes
As go is a language I do not have experience on. 
I followed a more "tutorial" based approach!

## Run code

### 1. Install dependencies
```
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```

### 2. Run main
```
go run main.go
```
### 3. Test 
```
go test
```
